          Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers,
          cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify
          your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our
          Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

        <p>
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
          activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no
          uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT
          browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online
          tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
